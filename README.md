# Overview

Bringing entertainment and fun into learning can improve learning outcomes and make students more engaged in the learning process. While my children are learning to type, I wanted to make a game that they could play that would also serve an educational purpose of improving their keyboarding skills.

For this keyboarding game, common words in the english language will fall from the top of the screen and players try to type the word correctly to make the word disappear. There is a never ending list of words because when one is successfully keyed in, another word is generated off screen and begins its descent.

Playing this game has helped me and my children with our keyboarding accuracy and can help others who wish to have fun in a new way while learning to type.

# Development Environment

I used Python to create this game. I found that the arcade library for Python was a big help to get this project off the ground.

# Useful Websites

* [Python Arcade Library Docs](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/index.html)

# Future Work

* I used a list of one thousand most commonly used words in the english language. To expand this game for users for whom english is not their preferred language, it would be helpful if I can support word lists with keys appropriate to users with alternate keyboard layouts (keyboards used in other countries, for example)
* It would be helpful to have a list of easy, medium, and hard words so that absolute beginners are not faced with words that may be too difficult for their skill level.
